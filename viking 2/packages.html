                            <p>Your small group training programs can be created around one of three general models: equipment-based, technique- or skill-based, or outcome-based.
Equipment-based small group training can appeal to people who prefer a certain style of training or equipment type, such as kettlebells or suspension training devices.
Technique- or skill-based small group training will allow for a targeted approach to individuals preparing for an activity or sport, such as kickboxing or mixed martial arts, marathon training, or ski conditioning.
Outcome-based small group training targets people who are looking for a specific physical result or change from the program – weight-loss, wedding preparation, fitting into “skinny jeans,” etc.</p>

    HOW THIS WORKS</h2>
                            <p>In our first session, we’ll spend 75 minutes together and I’ll do a full assessment to really get to know you. We’ll explore your relationship with food and body image, your diet history, eating patterns, health habits and more. We will talk about your goals and develop a plan to help you reach them.</p>
                            <p>Behavior change doesn’t happen overnight – it takes commitment and support to develop a healthy relationship with food and exercise. I’ll be there for ongoing support and accountability as you make health and nutrition changes.</p>
                            <p>After the initial session, we’ll check in weekly. This will typically consist of a food journal and progress photos. You can also email me anytime between sessions.</p>

    How this Works</h2>
                            <p>I understand how health insurances costs can be a huge economic burden to corporations, and it is only by providing  employees with user-friendly, practical health and fitness information that they can implement immediately is instrumental in a successful health and wellness program. A structured routine of workout sessions paired with educational seminars, I can lower healthcare costs by improving the health of employees.</p>
                            <h2>Offerings</h2>
                            <p>In House Group Training Programs:
    The way this program works is that if you have a conference room that can fit a majority of your employees, you can host group training classes for each of your employee’s. Price varies depending on number of employee’s and classes.</p>

                    <p>Over the years, I created dozens of structured workouts for myself. Stength based, muscle size based, weight lose based, you name, I've had to create a workout for it. And now you can purchase that templated work that helped me get to where I am now.</p>
                    <p>The best workout is the one that you do, and people make things FAR too complicated and try to target a bazillion different individual muscles with six types of exercises for each body part and it’s exhausting, unnecessary, inefficient, and intimidating. Take the guesswork out and purchase a custom written program that keeps it simple, We’re going to pick 5 exercises, and get really strong with those movements.</p>
                    <p>I’ll help you learn as much as you can about as many things as possible. A resource that serves to help you cultivate capability.  Help you push yourself towards             <i>suitability for success</i>, in whatever area of life you need it, based on what you learn about yourself on your time in the gym.</p>
                    <p>Its not for everyone. But it is for you.</p>
