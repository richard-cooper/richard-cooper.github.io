                        <p>I am Richard. After working in an office setting pushing pencils and papers across a desk for &nbsp;5+ years I left the confines of my cubicle to launch a career in a blue collar field: Apartment Remodeling. I tore walls down, rebuilt damaged drywall and lugged appliances up more flights of stairs than anyone ever should. I was wildly successful. And bored. I had romanticized&nbsp;&nbsp;the blue collar&nbsp;life. &nbsp;I had no creative freedom. A floor is a floor, a wall is a wall. I had no outlet for my creative needs.</p>
                        <p>Now as an empathetic UX Designer with a front end Developer skill set, I produce things driven by solid research guided by my previous experience and breaking/repairing/building.</p>
                        <p>Look at my work. You'll like it.</p>
